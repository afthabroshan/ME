- Integrates LLama3 with custom prompts and mitigation plans

### 🔹 [Intelligent-Audio-Inference-System](https://github.com/afthabroshan/Intelligent-Audio-Inference-System)
An intelligent system that allows users to **search for specific words inside audio content**—just like Ctrl+F for sound.

- Upload audio or provide links to long conversations, interviews, or lectures.
- Uses **Google Speech-to-Text** for transcription and **Gentle Forced Aligner** for precise word-level timestamps.
- Users can **search** for words, and the system jumps directly to that part in the audio.
- Ideal for journalists, researchers, and accessibility tools.
- Built using Docker, Streamlit, and pre-trained models for quick deployment.
